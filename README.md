# Digital Literacy Content

Materials and links I use (or plan to use) for junior high Digital Literacy / tech classes. This repo is meant to be a living library I can grow over time and reuse across courses.

## How This Repo Is Organized

- **Purpose:** Central place to collect links, files, and lesson ideas for Digital Literacy.
- **Audience:** Me (and potentially other teachers) planning units, grabbing links for Canvas, or building activities quickly.
- **Sections below:**
  - **Learning Resources** – full curricula, professional learning, scope & sequence.
  - **Student Practice** – sites where students actually *do* the thing (typing, coding, projects).
  - **Creative & Productivity Tools** – apps we use in class for creating products.

As this grows, I can:
- Add **subfolders** (e.g., `unit_1_introduction_to_ai`, `unit_2_digital_citizenship`).
- Drop in **Google Doc / Slide templates**, exported PDFs, and assignment descriptions.

## Learning Resources (Curriculum & PD)

Resources that provide full lessons or professional learning, usually with built-in activities.

- **Code.org – Professional Learning**  
  <https://code.org/en-US/professional-learning>  
  PD, lesson plans, and teaching guides that align with K–12 CS and digital literacy content.

- **Code.org – Course & Lesson Catalog**  
  <https://studio.code.org/catalog>  
  Browse all Code.org units and courses (great for pulling specific lessons or Hour of Code activities).

- **Common Sense Education – Digital Citizenship Curriculum**  
  <https://www.commonsense.org/education/digital-citizenship/curriculum>  
  Free, research-backed K–12 digital citizenship curriculum focused on online safety, media literacy, and digital well-being.

- **Google Applied Digital Skills**  
  <https://applieddigitalskills.withgoogle.com>  
  Free, video-based curriculum where students build real-world projects (resumes, planning sheets, interactive stories) while learning tools like Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

- **Google for Education – CS & Digital Skills for Educators**  
  <https://grow.google/educators/>  
  Training for teachers plus links to CS / digital skills programs (including CS First and other resources).

> 💡 Use this section when you’re planning units, aligning to standards, or need ready-made lesson sequences.

## Student Practice & Skill-Building

Links students can use directly for practice, projects, or extension work.

### Coding & Computational Thinking

- **Code.org Labs & Activities**  
  (linked via the catalog above) – block-based coding, puzzles, and short activities appropriate for middle school.

- **Scratch (MIT)**  
  <https://scratch.mit.edu>  
  Block-based coding platform for creating stories, animations, and games. Great for projects that connect to Digital Literacy, design, and storytelling.

### Digital Skills & Productivity

- **Applied Digital Skills – Student Lessons**  
  <https://applieddigitalskills.withgoogle.com>  
  Students follow video lessons to complete projects using Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.).

- **Typing Practice (placeholder)**  
  - *TypingClub*: <https://www.typingclub.com>  
  - *Nitro Type*: <https://www.nitrotype.com> (gamified typing races)  

*(Decide later which one(s) fit your school policies and add notes.)*

## Creative & Productivity Tools

Tools students can use to create products (presentations, graphics, documents) during your course.

- **Canva for Education**  
  <https://www.canva.com/education/>  
  100% free for K–12 teachers and students; templates for presentations, posters, infographics, etc.

- **Google Workspace (Docs, Slides, Sheets, Forms)**  
  Typically available via school Google accounts; used for writing, collaboration, data, and simple surveys/quizzes.

- **Adobe Express for Education** (if available in district)  
  <https://www.adobe.com/express/education.html>  
  Simple tools for web pages, short videos, and graphics.

> 💡 This section pairs well with digital literacy projects (brochures, infographics, digital posters, mini-portfolios).

## Ideas for Future Sections

As the repo grows, potential additions:

- **Unit Folders**  
  - `unit_1_intro_to_computers`
  - `unit_2_digital_citizenship`
  - `unit_3_creating_with_media`
  - `unit_4_ai_and_data_literacy`

- **Assignment Templates**  
  - Google Doc / Slide templates exported as `.docx` / `.pptx` or `.pdf`.
  - Rubrics and checklists.

- **Tagging Convention (optional)**  
  In link lists, add quick tags like:
  - `[curriculum]`, `[pd]`, `[practice]`, `[creative]`  
  so it’s easy to scan or Ctrl+F later.

_This README is a starting point. I’ll keep adding resources, notes, and unit folders as I refine my Digital Literacy course._

# Digital Literacy Content

Materials and links I use (or plan to use) for junior high Digital Literacy / tech classes. This repo is meant to be a living library I can grow over time and reuse across courses.

## How This Repo Is Organized

- **Purpose:** Central place to collect links, files, and lesson ideas for Digital Literacy.
- **Audience:** Me (and potentially other teachers) planning units, grabbing links for Canvas, or building activities quickly.
- **Sections below:**
  - **Learning Resources** – full curricula, professional learning, scope & sequence.
  - **Student Practice** – sites where students actually *do* the thing (typing, coding, projects).
  - **Creative & Productivity Tools** – apps we use in class for creating products.

As this grows, I can:
- Add **subfolders** (e.g., `unit_1_introduction_to_ai`, `unit_2_digital_citizenship`).
- Drop in **Google Doc / Slide templates**, exported PDFs, and assignment descriptions.
